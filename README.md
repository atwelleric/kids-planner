# kids-planner
---							
## **Project description**
	The idea for my project is to create a daily planner type app for children. 
	The thought is, kids usually have no idea what the weather will be like today without asking, 
	or what they are doing that day without checking with an adult.   While talking to my daughter 
	she absolutely loved the idea.   The parents will be able to set schedule events like school, 
	homework, girl scouts, and the kids will be able to make schedule suggestions for approval by 
	the parents.   I will be implementing a weather api and attempting to make the information more 
	accessible to children (instead of 70%  chance of rain today,   “Looks like it may rain, don’t forget an umbrella!)

## **User stories**

- As a user I want to see a friendly and easy to understand weather update.

- As a user I want to be able to suggest updates to my daily schedule.

- As a user I want an easy to navigate nav bar to get to weather updates, daily schedule and any other post mvp features.

## **Post mvp:**
- As a user my daughter has suggested random pictures of “cats playing with puppies” 
or random facts everyday. Should be easy to implement

- Nav bar that transitions from the side of the screen when activated would be nice.

- Different backgrounds that can change depending on what is returned from the weather api.

## **Sample api data:** 
`(this was a quick search from one of the weather apis suggested, I have not settled on which API 
i will use for this project yet.)
